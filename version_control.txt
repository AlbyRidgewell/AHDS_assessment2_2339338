## Version control

Git and GitHub were used throughout. To provide evidence of this without breaking anonymity, I will describe the steps I took. 

I initialised the repository and initially pushed this repository to GitHub using the following commands:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/...
git branch -M master
git push -u origin master

Then I regularly pushed my repository to GitHub using the following commands, commenting the changes I made each time:

git add .
git commit -m "comment"
git push -u origin master

I checked the status at each step using the following:

git status

I initially used Git Large File Storage for the large PAXRAW_D.csv file, but no longer needed to once I decided not to use that data set.
